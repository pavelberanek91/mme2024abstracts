\begin{Abstrakt}
Artificial Intelligence (along with data sciences and optimization) has been a fundamental component of many activities in economics and finance in recent years. In this lecture, we first summarize some of the major impacts of AI tools in economics and finance and discuss future developments and limitations. In the second part of the lecture, we present details on neural network embeddings on corporate annual filings for portfolio selection.
