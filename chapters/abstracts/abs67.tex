\begin{Abstrakt}
    Real options approach can be applied to a variety of investment opportunities to help investors improve risk management and make more informed decisions. Since a chooser option is a contract written on the maximum of the set of individual real options providing certain (mutually different) investment opportunities, this flexibility makes chooser options particularly relevant for valuing investment opportunities that involve uncertainty and the need for strategic decision-making. In this paper, we present an incorporation of chooser options into the valuation process and examine their valuation via contingent claims framework under single-factor uncertainty. The resulting PDE problems are of the Black-Scholes type and are solved using a discontinuous Galerkin approach. Finally, we provide a simple conceptual example of how chooser options can be used in investment scenarios facing a choice between expansion, contraction, or total abandonment.
