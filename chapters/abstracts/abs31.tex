    Emissions trading systems (ETS) have emerged as a crucial policy tool for tackling climate change by putting a price on carbon emissions. However, understanding the complex relations between environmental and economic criteria remains a challenge. This study explores the possibilities of fuzzy functional dependencies as a method to model the relationships between various criteria involved in assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of emissions trading schemes and the economic impacts of emissions trading within the EU ETS framework. By employing fuzzy functional dependencies, the analysis captures and explains the inherent uncertainty and vagueness in the relationships between environmental and economic variables within the EU ETS context. Finally, the article compares recognised relations among criteria by statistical methods.
