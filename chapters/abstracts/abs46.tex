\begin{Abstrakt}
    Decision-making processes often rely on stochastic models due to the inherent uncertainty in evaluating alternatives. This study investigates how the weights of criteria within the central weight vector, derived via the Stochastic Multi-criteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA) method, affect the valuation of additional information. Applying SMAA across various decision-making scenarios, we examined the correlation between criteria weights and the variability of acceptability and confidence indices after integrating supplementary data. Our analysis reveals a direct relationship: higher weights in the central weight vector significantly increase the impact of additional information on alternative evaluations, as evidenced by increased variance in both indices. These findings offer a strategic framework for decision-makers to efficiently allocate resources towards obtaining additional information for the most influential criteria and alternatives, thereby optimizing the decision-making process.
