\begin{Abstrakt}
    Data envelopment analysis is a popular quantitative method of relative efficiency evaluation of health systems. However, such efficiency evaluation has to deal with many pitfalls that result from the fact that the production of health differs from the traditional theory of production as we know it from economic textbooks. The definition of production output (health) is problematic, as it is unclear how to measure population health. Other pitfalls are related to health being affected by factors outside the health system. The causal relationship between inputs and outputs is complicated and uncertain. We also need to assume that the health systems are homogeneous production units.
