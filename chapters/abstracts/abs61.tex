\begin{Abstrakt}
    Several different methods can be utilized to examine the interdependence of individual criteria in a multi-criteria model for employee evaluation or selection, and the influence of these relationships on the weights of criteria. These methods include, for example, correlation analysis, fuzzy functional dependencies (FFD), or principal component analysis. This work focuses on creating a model utilizing fuzzy functional dependencies, aiming to analyze the relationships between criteria for employee evaluation, which are not represented by classical sets of values but by fuzzy sets. The results obtained through FFD are further used to calculate the weights of individual criteria within the selected multi-criteria method.
