\begin{Abstrakt}
    The paper provides a natural language processing analysis based on press releases of three established  institutional stakeholders in Czech economy who are traditionally getting coverage in Czech media. The press releases by the Czech Chamber of Commerce, Czech-Moravian Confederation of Trade Unions and by the Confederation of Industry of the Czech Republic are analysed in this paper. The aim of the paper is to learn what is the sentiment polarity in recent press releases of these institutions and if there is a major difference in sentiment between the institutions. The results of basic analysis and polarity sentiment scores are reported.\newline The results of a dictionary based sentiment analysis show that all three institutions produced documents of mixed polarity within the period selected for the analysis. Most documents have positive sentiment polarity, but there were documents with negative polarity too. The Czech-Moravian Confederation of Trade Unions produced press releases with the lowest mean polarity score, but there is no major difference in sentiment polarity score in documents with respect to the institution which has produced them.
