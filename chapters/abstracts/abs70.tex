\begin{Abstrakt}
    One-stage expansion options are a category of real options that enable expanding an investment project by a predetermined factor at a certain cost on a specified future date. Assuming that the price of the underlying commodity and its volatility follow a geometric Brownian motion, the valuation model for expansion options is represented by several partial differential equations. The objective is to introduce a pricing model for one-stage expansion options, propose an efficient wavelet-based method for its numerical solution, and implement this method to address practical problems. The method employs the Crank-Nicolson scheme combined with the Galerkin method using a cubic spline wavelet basis. Its application to a benchmark problem within the iron-ore mining industry demonstrates the suitability and applicability of the method and also highlights its numerical advantages, which include higher-order convergence and a small number of iterations necessary to attain the desired accuracy.
