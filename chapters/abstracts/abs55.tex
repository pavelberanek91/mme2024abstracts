\begin{Abstrakt}
    In this paper, different dynamic portfolio optimization strategies are examined under the usage of the robust second order stochastic dominance (RSSD) model, with a particular focus on its application to the stocks that are included in the S\&P 500 index. In contrary to traditional investment approaches, which often rely on assumptions about historical returns and volatility, the RSSD model is recognized for its advanced handling of uncertainties and the dynamic characteristics of financial markets, proposing a good base for constructing portfolios. By subjecting various dynamic investing strategies to simulation and comparing their performances to the S\&P 500 index benchmark, the potential of the RSSD model in augmenting portfolio returns and enhancing risk management is evaluated. Comprehensive analysis is employed with the aim of demonstrating how the RSSD model can be utilized by investors to make more informed and effective investment decisions, thereby optimizing the performance of their investment portfolios in the midst of market fluctuations. The outcomes of this research are intended to contribute significant insights for both academic investigation and practical implementation in the field of finance.
