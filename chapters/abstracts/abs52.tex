    In the past few years, Artificial Intelligence has advanced significantly technologically and is now easier to incorporate into analytics programs already in use.\newline The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of AI Merlion's modelling and forecasting techniques compared to established time series modelling software. Automatic and  semi-automatic model was built by AI Merlion, using Python library. The predictive capabilities of these models were compared with the ARIMA modelling using Eviews 13 software. By contrasting the models' forecasts with actual price movements, historical data on commercial real estate prices were utilized to assess each model's predictive accuracy.\newline The acccurancy of a forecasting models was evaluate with commonly used Error measures based on squared, absolute and percentage errors: RMSE, MAE and sMAPE. By highlighting the possible benefits and drawbacks of AI-powered techniques in the context of financial time series modeling, this comparative analysis adds new insights to the field of prediction algorithms.
