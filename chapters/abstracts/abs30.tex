\begin{Abstrakt}
    The article aims to create a Cobb-Douglas production function for the manufacturing industry, both for the entire industry and for individual sectors. First, a correlation analysis will be performed, then the Cobb-Douglas production function will be constructed, and the relevant coefficients will be calculated using the least squares method. The degree of determination will then be verified for the entire model. The process will be carried out for individual manufacturing industry sectors in the next part. The different degrees of determination will be discussed in individual sectors and the whole.
