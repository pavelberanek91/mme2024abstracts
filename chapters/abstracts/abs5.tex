    This paper introduces an approach for solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) for a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles in MS Excel. MS Excel, along with its optimization solver add-in application with implemented evolutionary algorithm, was selected as the platform for development of the procedure. The evolutionary algorithm enables MS Excel to identify sub-optimal routes of the considered problems within a short timeframe. The second part of the paper presents two examples that illustrate the application of the proposed procedure for a TSP with 23 locations, and a VRP with 26 locations. All locations are situated in Prague, the capital city of the Czech Republic, and its vicinity. The results prove the effectiveness of the algorithm in optimizing route planning for urban environments, highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios.
