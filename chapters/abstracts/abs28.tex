\begin{Abstrakt}
    This study explores in depth the intricate relationship between market attention and portfolio optimization. Employing a rolling window methodology, we extract Google Trends time series data for selected stocks, utilizing it as a proxy for market attention. This market attention indicator is then integrated into a suitable Google Trends model. With this model, the market attention directed towards a stock is effectively translated into corresponding weights for portfolio optimization. Our comparative analysis shows the results of traditional portfolio optimization side-by-side with the results of market attention enhancement. The findings suggest that combining market attention with portfolio optimization can significantly enhance portfolio selection strategies. This study helps to further validate the constructive impact of market focus on portfolio optimization.
