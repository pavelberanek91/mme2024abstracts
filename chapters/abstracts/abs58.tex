\begin{Abstrakt}
    Routing problems pose significant challenges in optimization. The fractional orienteering problem is no exception. While the Charnes–Cooper transformation allows for linearization of the model, efficiently solving large instances necessitates the use of heuristics. In this study, we propose an innovative algorithm based on ant colony optimization to address the fractional orienteering problem. Our approach involves a non-trivial adaptation of the basic ant colony optimization framework to account for mandatory nodes, enhancing its performance in real-world scenarios.
