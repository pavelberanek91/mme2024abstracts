\begin{Abstrakt}
    Swap operation used in neighborhood search heuristics can be modified in many ways introducing various parameters, which play an important role in the search termination rule, move accessibility definition and heuristic strategy determination. These parameters may considerably influence efficiency of the optimization process taking into account the objective function improvement and associated computational time. In this paper, we deal with the general problem of finding a good approximation of Pareto front, which consists of non-dominated p-location problem solutions. The applied gradual refinement process consists of enormous number of runs of the neighborhood search heuristic influenced by the parameter settings. In connection with the search for the correct setting of parameter values, we conducted research on swap heuristic behavior with the aim of revealing which parameters belong to the class of sensitive parameters.
