\begin{Abstrakt}
    Data envelopment analysis models are commonly presented in two forms: the envelopment form and the multiplier form. Both forms are essential for proper interpretation and application of the model. In this contribution, we focus on a specific subclass of DEA models called path-based models. This subclass includes radial, directional distance function, and hyperbolic distance function models as special cases. We present a general envelopment framework for path-based models that allows them to be extended to arbitrary data and discuss some of their properties. We also derive the general multiplier form and the optimality conditions, which can be used in the returns-to-scale measurement. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of these results with numerical examples.
