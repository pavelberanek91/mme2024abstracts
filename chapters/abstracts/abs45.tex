\begin{Abstrakt}
    The paper deals with a discrete-time version of the overshooting model. Insights into short-run currency market behaviour are often provided by the exchange rate overshooting principle, which illustrates how equilibrium levels are initially quickly overshooted before a slower adjustment occurs. The model is formulated as a system of difference equations using lagarithmic transformation. Within this framework, transient exchange rate deviations within discrete time intervals are also analysed. In addition, the model can be used to formulate and discuss a qualitative analysis of the various possible policy options.
