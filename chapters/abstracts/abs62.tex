\begin{Abstrakt}
    Floorball, a global phenomenon, demands peak player efficiency for teams to thrive. However, current evaluation methods are often subjective. This research introduces objective tools for floorball clubs, managers, and coaches. We are using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), specifically the basic CCR and BCC models with different variables according to the type of players. We assess the technical efficiency of players in the Czech Extraliga, the top men's league, across an entire season. Analysing players overall, then by attackers and defenders, we identify areas for improvement based on playing position and team affiliation. This novel approach demonstrates the potential of DEA for efficiency measurement, paving the way for a more systematic and objective methodology and coaching in floorball player assessment.
