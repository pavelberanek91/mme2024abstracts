\begin{Abstrakt}
    In multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM), the weights, expressing the importance of criteria for a decision-maker, are a crucial factor. Usually, the MCDM methods assume mutually independent criteria. On the other hand, in some situations, this assumption is too strong and could bring heavily distorted results. The literature provides some ways how to reflect such dependencies in the weights of criteria (e.g., CRITIC method or Choquet integral) but they suffer from weaknesses like the direction of dependency. This paper adopts the concept of fuzzy functional dependencies (FFDs) and criteria weights assignment. FFDs reveal not only the strength of the dependence but also its direction (causality); they can work with the uncertain input data (including qualitative variables or fuzzy numbers). The goal of this paper is to propose a model which uses FFDs to adjust the criteria weights in order to reflect the impact of dependencies. The model is verified using a real-life example.
