\begin{Abstrakt}
    The study explores the intricate relationship between crude oil and global fertilizer prices, highlighting fertilizer's significant role in food commodity costs. While prior research has emphasized crude oil's impact, this study unveils the extensive economic and social repercussions of fertilizer market shocks. Investigating potential asymmetric price transmission, the study employs a Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) model to analyze the nonlinear dynamics between spot prices of various fertilizers and crude oil. By utilizing the Bai-Perron method to identify structural changes, the study unveils both symmetric and asymmetric responses in fertilizer prices over different time periods, underscoring the dynamic nature of this crucial relationship.
